# SMS spam detection using Pyspark
This was an assignment in the "Big Data Analytics" course that I studied at university.

"Given [UCI's SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection), use Spark to implement an ML pipeline to classify SMSs into spam or ham."

Steps included:
1. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
2. Data Cleaning.
3. Text Preprocessing.
4. Predicting using Linear SVC and logistic regression, and comparing the results.
